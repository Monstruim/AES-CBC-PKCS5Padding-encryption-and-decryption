# AES-CBC-PKCS5Padding-encryption-and-decryption
2021 Simple AES Cypher Block Chaining (CBC) encryption and decryption in java 

The algorithm uses                                                                                                                                             
1-Key - the secret key that can be set by the user                                                                                                                                                       
2-Plaintext - message or text that wanted to be encrypted.                                                                                                                                             
3-Inetial vector - A binary vector used as the input to initialize the algorithm for the encryption.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               

Bellow Image shows how the encryption works and the input of each varible.
